Prepare and develop end-to-end pipeline for a weather conditions classification light-weight neural network.

As an input this model should take a video sequence from CCTV camera; 
As an output model should classify weather conditions (Clear, Rain, Snow). 

Network should be light enough to run in realtime on a Jetson Nano device.
